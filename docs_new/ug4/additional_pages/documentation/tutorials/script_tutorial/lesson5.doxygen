/** \page pageSTLesson5 Lesson 5 - Global Refinement

This script shows how a domain can be refined, both before and after parallel 
distribution.
To keep things easy, a global refiner is used.
Adaptive refinement is subject to later tutorials.

Below you'll find the scripts sources.
They are the same as in <tt>scripts/tutorials/tut05_global_refinement.lua</tt>.

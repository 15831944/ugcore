/** \page pageSTLesson3 Lesson 3 - Laplace with Exact Solver

This tutorial is based on \ref pageSTLesson2 .
It shows how a discretization of the Laplace problem can be set up and how an 
exact solver can be used to solve the problem.
We will use script callbacks to specify the diffusion tensor and the right hand 
side as well as the Dirichlet boundary values.
The results are finally written to a <tt>.vtk</tt> file which can be opened 
with <em>ParaView</em> or similar software.

Below you'll find the scripts sources.
They are the same as in <tt>scripts/tutorials/tut03_laplace_with_exact_solver.lua</tt>.

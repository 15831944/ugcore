/** \page pageUG4OnWindows Setting up UG4 on Windows

<strong>UG4</strong> supports Windows through the <em>MinGW</em> gcc-compilers.
<em>MinGW</em> can be downloaded together with <em>MSYS</em> at 
http://www.mingw.org/wiki/MSYS .  
<em>MSYS</em> is a <em>'minimal shell'</em>, which mimics some of the features 
of unix shells.
You should install <em>MSYS</em> and <em>MinGW</em> to a rather simple path 
which does not contain spaces or special characters (e.g. <tt>C:\\msys</tt>).

Compiliation of <strong>ug4</strong> furthermore requires the installation of 
<em>CMake</em>, which can be obtained from 
<a href="http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html">here</a> (min 
Release 2.6).

You should be able to run <em>CMake</em> from your <em>MSYS</em> shell (simply 
type <tt>cmake</tt> and press enter).
If <tt>cmake</tt> can't be found, then you should add the path to the 
<em>CMake</em> binary to your systems <tt>PATH</tt> variable.

In order to checkout <strong>UG4</strong> from its <em>svn</em> repository 
you'll either have to follow the instructions on how to setup <em>Eclipse</em> 
with svn capabilities (cf. \ref pageInstallEclipse) or you'll have to install 
<em>Tortoise SVN</em> (http://tortoisesvn.net/), depending on whether you want 
to develop with <strong>UG4</strong> or just compile it.
<em>Tortoise SVN</em> is an extension to the Windows Explorer and allows to 
perform checkouts and commits through the right-click-menu directly in the 
explorer.

If you're using <em>Tortoise SVN</em>, then open the explorer and navigate to 
the folder in which you want to install <strong>UG4</strong>.
Create a new folder called <tt>ug4</tt>, perform a right click on it and choose 
<em>svn checkout</em> from the menu.
Enter the repository adress (e.g. svn://fuji.gcsc.uni-frankfurt.de/ug4/trunk), 
your username and password.

You should now have received a full checkout of <strong>UG4</strong>'s sources.
Now open the <em>MSYS</em> shell and navigate to the <strong>UG4</strong> folder 
you just created.
Note that folders in <em>MSYS</em> are specified in a Unix way, e.g. 
<tt>cd /c/ug4</tt>)

If you chose <em>Eclipse</em>, then please follow the tutorial given in 
\ref pageInstallEclipse to set up <em>Eclipse</em> and how to checkout 
<strong>UG4</strong>.

Compilation and <em>CMake</em> calls are very similar to Unix and to the 
description given in \ref pageInstallUG4.
However one important thing to note is, that one has to explicitly specifiy the 
compiler, which shall be used by <em>CMake</em>.
A call to <em>CMake</em> thus should start as follows:

\verbatim
cmake -G"MSYS Makefiles"
\endverbatim

This is however only necessary when you invoke <em>CMake</em> the first time 
for a given folder.

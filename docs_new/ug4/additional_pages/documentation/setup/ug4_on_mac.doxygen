/** \page pageUG4OnMac Setting up UG4 on Mac

To install <strong>UG4</strong> on Mac OSX you need a working toolchain.
For me it wasn't hassle-free as compared with a Unix based system, therefore 
I searched the web.

Downloading and installing the massive <em>Xcode</em> installer is a huge 
hassle if you just want GCC and related tools.
The <tt>osx-gcc-installer</tt> allows you to install the essential compilers 
from either pre-built binary packages or helps you create your own installer.

There is a bundle called <em>OSX GCC Installer</em> (see above) which contains 
up-to-date versions of:
- GCC
- Clang
- LLVM
- Developer CLI Tools (purge, etc.)
- DevSDK (headers, etc.)


Steps:
<ul>
  <li>Download the prebuilt pkg from:
    https://github.com/kennethreitz/osx-gcc-installer/
    (alternatively you can download <em>Command Line Tools</em> for 
    <em>Xcode</em> with a free apple ID from 
    http://developer.apple.com/downloads )
  </li>
  <li>Install the pkg.
    For me the prebuilt pkgs worked flawless on <em>Snow Leopard</em> and 
    <em>Lion</em>, too (compiled <em>UG4 rev 5289</em> with <em>clang</em> and 
    <em>gcc</em>)
  </li>
</ul>

\note Please note, you can build your own.
See http://kennethreitz.com/xcode-gcc-and-homebrew.html for further information.

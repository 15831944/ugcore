# Toolchain file for JuQueen (type IBM Blue Gene/Q) FZ Juelich.
#
# This toolchain file is included in a CMake run by (check with 'cmake --trace')
# 'Modules/CMakeDetermineSystem.cmake', and (later again) by the - generated -
# file '<ug4_build_dir>/CMakeFiles/CMakeSystem.cmake'.
# (Subdirectory 'Modules/' is part of your CMake installation, on JuQueens login
# nodes: '/usr/local/cmake/share/cmake-2.8/Modules/').
#
# Appropriate platform files for the "CMake system name" and compilers chosen
# here are called later (by 'Modules/CMakeSystemSpecificInformation.cmake'):
#
# I.e., for "BlueGeneQ-static" as "CMake system name" the platform file
# 'Modules/Platform/BlueGeneQ-static.cmake' is included first, which includes
# 'Modules/Platform/BlueGeneQ-base.cmake'. Afterwards CMake calls
# 'Modules/Platform/BlueGeneQ-static-GNU-C.cmake' and
# 'Modules/Platform/BlueGeneQ-static-GNU-CXX.cmake'
# if GNU compilers are chosen (by 'Modules/CMakeCInformation.cmake' and
# 'Modules/CMakeCXXInformation.cmake' respectively).

#
# Attention:
# For this to work a CMake version with platform files for Blue Gene/Q is required!
# The currently (October 2012) installed version on JuQueen does not (the FZJ
# support is asked to support one).
#
# In the meantime one can resort to a local installation of (the most recent
# version of) CMake, where appropriate platform files are copied into the
# 'Modules/Platform/' sub directory:
#
#  ~/local/share/cmake-2.8/Modules/Platform/BlueGeneQ-*.cmake
#
# The following is based on information from
# 'https://code.google.com/p/elemental/source/browse/cmake/toolchains/BGQ-gnu-netlib.cmake',
# utilising platform files from
# 'http://www.cmake.org/Bug/bug_relationship_graph.php?bug_id=13512&graph=dependency'
# (found 03092012), which are copied into the 'Modules/Platform/' directory of
# a locally installed CMake, version 2.8.9 (installed 03092012).

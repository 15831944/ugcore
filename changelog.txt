@rev 26: sreiter - y09 m11 d3
-	Added pcl (Parallel Communication Layer) to ugbase.
-	Added libGrid-Documentation.
-	Added ParallelToolchain files which are required to compile pcl.
-	Removed grid_unit_test, which was unintentionally merged into the trunk.

@rev 24: sreiter - y09 m10 d30
-	Removed standard implementation of hash_key in common/util/hash.h.
	Added specialization hash_key<uint>.
	The standard implementation prevented compiler errors which are
	important to find problems with the specialization of the hash_key
	function.

@rev 3 - sreiter
-	changed typedef of uint to unsigned int in common/types.h
	* compatibility reasons with Qt,
	* uint should be short form of unsigned int.

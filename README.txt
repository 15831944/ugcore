ug4 has been written and is still developed at the
Goethe Center for Scientific Computing at the University of Frankfurt, Germany 
(http://www.g-csc.de).

For information on how to install and use ug4, please have a look at the
ug4 documentation.

You can create the documentation on your own using doxygen. Simply execute
doxygen with the configuration file "doxy_config_ug4.txt". You will then
find the html-documentation at docs/ug4/html/index.html.

Information on licensing and copyrights can be found in the ug4-documentation, too.

# all you need to specify is the height and the width of your display, for example, if you have a
# screen that is 1280x800 pixels:
# maxw = 2000
# maxh = 1200
# you can adjust deplacements with dx and dy, for example, if you have a second screen.
# if windows are overlapping, you might have to adjust charWidth/HeightFactor10.

maxw=1700
maxh=800
dx=1800
dy=100

 * This method is mostly used internally during oct-tree-construction.

 * This method recursivly calls itself.

 * Make sure that all passed points lie inside the parent-nodes box.

 *
 * \param numPoints: The number of points in the points array.

 * \param elemInds: Array of indices which reference the points array.
 *				'numIndsPerElem' consecutive indices form an element.

 *
 * \param bLoose: if true, elems will be assigned to the box that contains
 *				their center. Each element will be assigned to exactly one
 *				leaf-node in this case. Note that the bounding-boxes of a
 *				loose tree normally overlap each other.
 *
 *				if false, elems will be assigned to each leaf-node, whose
 *				box intersects the element. Each element may be assigned to
 *				multiple leaf-nodes in this case. However the boxes of
 *				leaf-nodes will not overlap in this case.

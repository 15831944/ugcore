/**
 * \brief The grid library.
 *
 * lib_grid not only defines basic types like ug::Grid and ug::MultiGrid,
 * it also features tools such as the ug::Selector, ug::MGSelector,
 * ug::SubsetHandler and ug::MGSubsetHandler as well as a vast collection
 * of methods that work on those types. Those can mostly be found in the
 * \ref lib_grid_algorithms section.

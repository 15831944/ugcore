/**
 * The grid observer defines an interface that can be specialized by
 * classes that want to be informed about changes in a grid.
 * If a class derives from GridObserver, it can be registered at a grid.
 * Registration is usually performed through a member function of the
 * observer class itself.
 * Most observers can only be registered at one grid at a time.
 *
 * Please note that methods of different observers are called in the
 * order in which they were registered at the grid. The only exception
 * are the vertex_to_be_erased, edge_to_be_erased, face_to_be_erased and
 * volume_to_be_erased. Those method are called in reverse order of
 * registration.

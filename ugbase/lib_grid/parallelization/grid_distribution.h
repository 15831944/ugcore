 * have to specify your parts in the SubsetHandler.
 * The part for the local (the calling) process (specified by localProcID)
 * won't be send through the network, instead it will be directly written
 * to pLocalGridOut, pLocalSubsetHandlerOut and pLocalGridCommSetOut - if
 * those are specified.
 * All three should be empty before calling this method. Passing NULL only makes
 * sense if you specified a processMap that has no entry for the calling
 * process.
 * You may optionally specify a process-map. This map is represented by
 * a std::vector<int> which should have as many entries as there are
 * subsets in the SubsetHandler. Each entry specifies the target process
 * for the associated subset. You may pass NULL as parameter. The grids
 * are distributed to processes 0 to sh.num_subsets()-1 in this case.
 *
 * Grids distributed through this method may be received by ReceiveGrid.

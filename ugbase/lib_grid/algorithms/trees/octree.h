 * The elements to which the iterators point have to be derivates of
 * ug::Edge or ug::Face and have to represent edges or triangles.
 * Furthermore all elements between elemsBegin and elemsBegin have to 
 * be members of the specified grid.
 *
 * Each element in the resulting octree will store a pointer to the

 * using the CollisionEdgesNode::get_edge_id or
 * CollisionTrianglesNode::get_triangle_id method to retreive it.
 *
 * This method internally uses the ug::node_tree::CreateOctree method.

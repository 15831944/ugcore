 * In this case however, the refinement is not regular - faces are
 * refined in a way to avoid hanging nodes.
 *
 * Pass a grid and a selector (which is working on the grid). The
 * provided aInt is required by the algorithm to store temporary
 * values. You have to pass it to the algorithm to allow
 * maximal speed for repeated small refinements.
 * 
 * All involved geometric objects will be selected after the method
 * terminated (This includes vertices adjacent to selected edges and faces).
 *
 * aInt has to be attached to the edges of the grid.
 *
 * If you are interested in rare, big refinements, you may also use
 * the overloaded version of Refine, which only takes a Grid and a 
 * Selector.

-	SubsetHandler and MGSubsetHandler are now both usable.
	Both share a common interface ISubsetHandler.
	Not yet carefully debugged!

@rev 81: sreiter - y09 m12 d09
-	A first working version of the pcl-specialization for lib_grid
	has been integrated. It can be found in
	lib_grid/algorithms/parallelization.
	It only features methods to copy values between interfaces
	in the moment.

@rev ??: sreiter - ??
-    	 The selector has been reworked and has now been implemented
	 using policy based design.
	 A specialization for normal Grids (Selector) and for MultiGrids
	 (MGSelector) exists.

@rev 31: sreiter - y09 m11 d06
-	Added Serialization support for Grid, SubsetHandler and for Attachments.

@rev 24: sreiter - y09 m10 d30
-	replaced FindEdge, FindFace and FindVolume in grid_util.h by
	Grid::get_edge, Grid::get_face and Grid::get_volume in grid.h.
	
-	replaced EdgeMatches, FaceMatches, VolumeMatches by
	CompareVertices (in grid_util.h)
	
-	Moved IsBoundary... from grid_util.h to the appropriate util-files
	in algorithms/geom_obj_util/
	
-	Created the common base class EdgeVertices for EdgeDescriptor
	and EdgeBase. Same for Face and Volume. Those common base-classes
	store vertices in arrays and allow vertex-access.
	
-	Added hash-functions for EdgeBase*, EdgeVertices* and EdgeDescriptor*.
	Same for Face and Volume.

-	Added a uint32 member m_hashValue to VertexBase. On creation a unique
	hash value is assigned to each vertex in the grid.

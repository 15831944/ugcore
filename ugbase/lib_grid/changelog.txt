@rev 24: sreiter - y09 m10 d30
-	replaced FindEdge, FindFace and FindVolume in grid_util.h by
	Grid::get_edge, Grid::get_face and Grid::get_volume in grid.h.
	
-	replaced EdgeMatches, FaceMatches, VolumeMatches by
	CompareVertices (in grid_util.h)
	
-	Moved IsBoundary... from grid_util.h to the appropriate util-files
	in algorithms/geom_obj_util/
	
-	Created the common base class EdgeVertices for EdgeDescriptor
	and EdgeBase. Same for Face and Volume. Those common base-classes
	store vertices in arrays and allow vertex-access.
	
-	Added hash-functions for EdgeBase*, EdgeVertices* and EdgeDescriptor*.
	Same for Face and Volume.

-	Added a uint32 member m_hashValue to VertexBase. On creation a unique
	hash value is assigned to each vertex in the grid.

/**
 * The storage type of a vector is used in parallel applications.
 * We assume that the dofs are distributed to the processes in the way that
 * each dof is master on exactly one process and can be a slave (i.e. a local
 * copy) on several other processes. Given the real values of the dofs the
 * different storage type are defined as follows:
 *  - PST_UNDEFINED: no information given
 *  - PST_CONSISTENT: The real value is saved in the master and every slave
 *  - PST_ADDITIVE: The sum over the values in the master and all slaves gives the exact value
 *  - PST_UNIQUE: Same as PST_ADDITIV, but value is zero in all slaves (i.e. master has exact value)
 *
 *  Note, that a Vector can have more than one type. E.g. every unique Vector
 *  is additive. Moreover, the Vector being zero everywhere is consistent,
 *  additive and unique at the same time. Therefore, the information is given
 *  bitwise.
 *
 *  To check, whether a Vector v is in a type one may ask:
 *  	 -- v.has_storage_type(PST_CONSISTENT), etc.
 *  To change into another type
 *       -- v.change_storage_type(PST_ADDITIVE)

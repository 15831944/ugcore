/**
 * This class is the base class for the inversion of the operator given in form
 * of the IOperator interface class. Given a operator N(u), the basic usage
 * of this class is to invert this operator, i.e. to compute
 *
 *     N(u) = 0, i.e. u := N^{-1}(0).
 *
 * This application has been split up into three steps:
 *
 * 1. init(N): This method initializes the inverse operator. The inverse operator
 * 			   is initialized the way that, its application will be the inverse
 * 			   application of the operator N passed in by this function. The
 * 			   prepare method can only be called, when this method has been
 * 			   called once.
 *
 * 2. prepare(u): This method prepares the function u, before it can be used in
 * 				  the apply method. Here, typically dirichlet values are set.
 *
 * 3. apply(u):	This method performs the inversion. Before this method is called
 * 				the init and prepare methods have to be called.
 *
 * This splitting has been made, since initialization and preparation may be
 * computationally expansive. Thus, the user of this class has the choice
 * when to call this initialization/preparation. E.g. when the operator is
 * applied several times on the same vectors, those have only to be prepared
 * once and the init of the operator is only needed once.

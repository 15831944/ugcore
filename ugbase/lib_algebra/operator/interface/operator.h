/**
 * This class is the base class for all mappings between two spaces. The domain
 * space and the codomain space are passed as template parameters. In particular,
 * the mapping can be nonlinear. For linear (or linearized) mappings see
 * ILinearizedOperator. The basic usage of this class is to provide the
 * computation of:
 *
 * 		d := N(u),
 *
 * where d is from the codomain space, u a function of the domain space and
 * N() is a (nonlinear-) mapping.
 *
 * This application is splitted into three methods, that have to be called
 * in the correct order:
 *
 * 1. init(): This method initializes the operator for application. It has
 * 			  to be called once before one of the other two methods can be
 * 			  invoked. There is no need to call this method more than once, but
 * 			  sometimes - due to parameter change - this is desirable and
 * 			  can be done.
 *
 * 2. prepare(): This method is used to prepare the in- and output vector used
 * 				 later in apply. It can be called, after the init method has
 * 				 been called at least once. The prepare method is e.g. used
 * 				 to set dirichlet values.
 *
 * 3. apply(): This method can be called when the operator has been initialized
 * 			   by a call of init and with two functions, that have been prepare
 * 			   using the prepare method. It maps the function from the domain
 * 			   space to the range space.
 *
 * This splitting has been made, since initialization and preparation may be
 * computationally expansive. Thus, the user of this class has the choice
 * when to call this initialization/preparation. E.g. when the operator is
 * applied several times on the same vectors, those have only to be prepared
 * once and the init of the operator is only needed once.
 *

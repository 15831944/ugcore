/*
 * In this file, quadrature rules for arbitray order for elements with dim > 1
 * are implemented. The basic idea relies on a transformation of the considered
 * domain to the unit cube [0,1]^d and then using Gauss quadratures to carry out
 * the integrals. Note, that on some elements the transformation introduces
 * jacobian determinants of type (1-x)^{\alpha}(1+x)^{\beta}. In order to
 * integrate those, the gauss-jacobi quadratures are used.

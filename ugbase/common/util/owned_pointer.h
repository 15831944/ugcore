///	Holds and automatically deletes a pointer, similar to std::auto_ptr. USE WITH CARE!
/**	WARNING: USE WITH CARE!
 * Class shows uncommon behavior when copied.
 *
 * The behavior of this class is very similar to std::auto_ptr and somewhat
 * similar to boost::scoped_ptr. It takes a pointer in its constructor and
 * automatically deletes the associated object in its destructor or in a call to reset.
 * The most notable property of OwnedPtr is that an OwnedPtr 'owns' the associated
 * object. That means that two OwnedPtrs should never point to the same instance.
 * The copy-constructor thus shows the somewhat irritating behavior of invalidating
 * the original copy and transferring the ownership of the associated object to
 * the new copy of OwnedPtr. This behavior again is the same in std::auto_ptr,
 * however, in contrary to std::auto_ptr, instances of OwnedPtr can be used
 * in standard containers like std::vector. This is explicitly not advised, since
 * many algorithms working with iterators or standard containers will not work
 * with OwnedPtrs.
 * Storing OwnedPtrs in lib_grids attachments may sometimes be useful. Therefore
 * this slightly dangerous class was introduced.

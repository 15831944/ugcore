# Enable the USE_MATHJAX option to render LaTeX formulas using MathJax
# (see http://www.mathjax.org) which uses client side Javascript for the
# rendering instead of using prerendered bitmaps. Use this if you do not
# have LaTeX installed or if you want to formulas look prettier in the HTML
# output. When enabled you may also need to install MathJax separately and
# configure the path to it using the MATHJAX_RELPATH option.

USE_MATHJAX            = YES

# When MathJax is enabled you can set the default output format to be used for
# thA MathJax output. Supported types are HTML-CSS, NativeMML (i.e. MathML) and
# SVG. The default value is HTML-CSS, which is slower, but has the best
# compatibility.

MATHJAX_FORMAT         = HTML-CSS

# When MathJax is enabled you need to specify the location relative to the
# HTML output directory using the MATHJAX_RELPATH option. The destination
# directory should contain the MathJax.js script. For instance, if the mathjax
# directory is located at the same level as the HTML output directory, then
# MATHJAX_RELPATH should be ../mathjax. The default value points to
# the MathJax Content Delivery Network so you can quickly see the result without
# installing MathJax.
# However, it is strongly recommended to install a local
# copy of MathJax from http://www.mathjax.org before deployment.

MATHJAX_RELPATH        = http://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest

# The MATHJAX_EXTENSIONS tag can be used to specify one or MathJax extension
# names that should be enabled during MathJax rendering.

\section secAbout About
ug4 has been written and is still developed at the
<i>Goethe Center for Scientific Computing at the University of Frankfurt, Germany </i>(http://www.g-csc.de).
 
Amongst others, the following people contributed to ug4:<br>

\section secWhatIsIt What is ug4?
ug4 is a compilation of libraries and applications, targetted at the solution of
differential equations on unstructured grids on massive parallel systems. ug4 is written
in c++, striving for a flexible, yet fast and robust environment.

The following main modules are the base of ug4:
	- common
	- \ref pageLAOverview "lib_algebra"
	- \ref pageLDIntroduction "lib_discretization"
	- \ref pageLGIntroduction "lib_grid"
	- parallel communication layer (pcl)

Other modules are:
	- node_tree
	- ug_script

Here are some of the ug4 applications:

\section secCompilation How to compile ug4
\todo: add explanation of the parameters and how to setup boost.
ug4 can be build using CMAKE (http://www.cmake.org/).
	- download the current source-distribution of cmake
	- build and install it (configure; make; install;)
	- change directory to the ug4 root directory (../libGrid)
	- create a new build directory (mkdir build)
	- change directory to the build directory (cd build)
	- call cmake with the ug4 path (cmake ../)
	- call make
 
You should now find all generated libs in ug4/lib and
the executable in ug4/bin.

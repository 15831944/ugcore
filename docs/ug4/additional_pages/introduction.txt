\section secWhatIsIt What is ug4?
ug4 is a simulation framework, targetted at the solution of
differential equations on unstructured grids on massive parallel systems. ug4 is written
in C++, striving for a flexible, yet fast and robust environment.

The following main modules are the base of ug4:
	- common
	- \ref pageLAOverview "lib_algebra"
	- \ref pageLDIntroduction "lib_discretization"
	- \ref pageLGIntroduction "lib_grid"
	- parallel communication layer (pcl)

Other modules are:
	- node_tree
	- ug_script

Here are some of the ug4 applications:

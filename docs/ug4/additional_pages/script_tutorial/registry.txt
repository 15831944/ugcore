In order to make functionality (such as c++ classes, methods and functions) 
available in the Lua-Script or the VRL, this functionality must be registered
by the c++ programmer. By this registration, the programmer indicates, that the
functionality is exported. Once exported the functionality is accessible in 
Script and VRL simultaneously.

This page gives an introduction to the registering process.

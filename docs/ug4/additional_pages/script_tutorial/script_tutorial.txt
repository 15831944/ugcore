One possibility to work with ug is the usage of the <b>Scripting facility</b>. 

The ug script is based on <b>Lua</b> (see www.lua.org). 

This tutorial is addressed to users starting to work with the ug-script for the
first time. Several lessons will give a step by step introduction to the broad 
world of commands, classes and functionality of ug, that can be used and controlled
by users without even programming a line of code in c/c++. In each lesson only
few small new aspects are added such that the user can focus on small parts 
of the script.

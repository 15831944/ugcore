This script shows how a domain can be refined, both before and after
parallel distribution. To keep things easy, a global refiner is used.
Adaptive refinement is subject to later tutorials.

Below you'll find the scripts sources. They are the same as in
scripts/tutorials/tut05_global_refinement.lua

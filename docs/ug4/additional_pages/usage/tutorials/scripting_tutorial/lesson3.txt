This tutorial is based on \ref pageSTLesson2 "Lesson 2 - Loading a Domain".
It shows how a discretization of the laplace problem can be set up and how an exact
solver can be used to solve the problem. We will use script callbacks to
specify the diffusion tensor and the right hand side as well as the dirichlet
boundary values. The results are finally written to a .vtk file which can be
opened with ParaView or similar software.

Below you'll find the scripts sources. They are the same as in
scripts/tutorials/tut03_laplace_with_exact_solver.lua.

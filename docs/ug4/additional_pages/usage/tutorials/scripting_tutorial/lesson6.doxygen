We already have seen how a grid can be distributed using 
<tt>DistributeDomain(...)</tt>.
In this tutorial however we'll take a look at how distribution can be controled
in a more flexible way.
We will thus take a look at how to prepare a <tt>PartitionMap</tt> and how to 
use it in a call to <tt>RedistributeDomain</tt>.

Below you'll find the scripts sources.
They are the same as in
<tt>scripts/tutorials/tut06_flexible_grid_distribution.lua</tt>

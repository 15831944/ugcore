/** \page pageSTLesson2 Lesson 2 - Loading a Domain

This is the first tutorial that actually controls ug4 from a Lua script.
We will load a domain and distribute it to several processes.
The tutorial furthermore shows how utility scripts can be loaded and how
command-line arguments can be accessed.

Below you'll find the scripts sources.
They are the same as in <tt>apps/tutorials/tut02_loading_a_domain.lua</tt>.

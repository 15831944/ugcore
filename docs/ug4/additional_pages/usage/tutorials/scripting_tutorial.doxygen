/** \page pageScriptTutorial ug-Script Tutorial

One possibility to work with ug4 is the usage of the <strong>Scripting 
facility</strong>. 

The <strong>ug-script</strong> is based on \em Lua (see http://www.lua.org). 

This tutorial is addressed to users starting to work with the <em>ug-script</em>
for the first time.
Several lessons will give a step by step introduction to the broad world of 
commands, classes and functionality of ug4, that can be used and controlled
by users without even programming a line of code in C/C++.
In each lesson only few small new aspects are added such that the user can 
focus on small parts of the script.

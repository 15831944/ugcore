/**	\page pageUG4OnWindows Setting up UG on windows

ug4 supports windows through the MinGW gcc-compilers. MinGW can be downloaded
together with MSYS at [REF]. MSYS is a 'minimal shell', which mimics some
of the features of unix shells. You should install MSYS and MinGW to a rather
simple path which does not contain spaces or special characters (e.g. C:\msys)

Compiliation of ug4 furthermore requires the installation of cmake, which can be
obtained from here
(cf. <a href="http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html">
http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html</a>
(min Release 2.6).

You should be able to run cmake from your MSYS shell (simply type cmake and press enter).
If cmake can't be found, then you should add the path to the cmake binary to your
systems PATH variable.

In order to checkout ug4 from its svn repository you'll either have to follow the
instructions on how to setup eclipse with svn capabilities
or you'll have to install tortoise svn ([REF]), depending on whether you want to
develop with ug or just compile it.
Tortoise svn is an extension to the windows explorer and
allows to perform checkouts and commits through the right-click-menu directly
in the explorer.

If you're using tortoise svn, then open the explorer and navigate to the folder
in which you want to install ug4. Create a new folder called 'ug4', perform
a right click on it and choose 'svn checkout' from the menu. Enter the repository
adress (e.g. svn://fuji.gcsc.uni-frankfurt.de/ug4/trunk), your username and password.

You should now have received a full checkout of ug4's sources. Now open the
msys shell and navigate to the ug4 folder you just created. Note that folders
in msys are specified in a unix way, e.g. 'cd /c/ug4')

If you chose eclipse, then please follow the tutorial given in \ref pageInstallEclipse
to set up eclipse and how to checkout ug4.

Compilation and cmake calls are very similar to unix and to the description given
in \ref pageInstallUG4. However one important thing to note is, that one has to
explicitly specifiy the compiler, which shall be used by cmake. A call to cmake
thus should start as follows:

cmake -G"MSYS Makefiles"

This is however only necessary when you invoke cmake the first time for a given folder.

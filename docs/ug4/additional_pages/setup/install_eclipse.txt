\section secInstallEcpliseUG4Download Download ug4 via Eclipse/SVN
<hr>

<ul>
<li> In Eclipse's Menu, choose "File" -> "New" -> "Other...", and there "SVN" -> "Project from SVN"
<li> URL is: "svn://fuji.gcsc.uni-frankfurt.de/ug4/trunk"

\section secInstallEcpliseUseMakefiles Build in Eclipse using external Makefiles
<hr>

In order to build the ug libraries via Eclipse, you first must create the 
Makefiles. This is done using "cmake" in the terminal (go \ref secInstallUG4CMake "here" if you did not already install CMake).

<ol>
<li> Open a terminal/shell window
<li> move into your workspace directory you chose before
<li> "cd ug4"
<li> "mkdir build_debug"
<li> "cd build_debug"
<li> "cmake -DUG_DEBUG=ON .." --> Makefiles are generated
</ol>

Note, that once the Makefiles have been created, you do not have to rebuild them
 at any time. This step has to be performed only once. 
Now, these Makefiles can be used in Eclipse:

<ol>
<li> Click right on folder "ug4" -> Choose "Properties"
<li> Under "C/C++-Build":
<li> Disable "Generate Makefiles automatically"
<li> Disable "Use default build command"
<li> Choose "Build directory: ..." -> Click "Filesystem" -> Choose newly created
 	folder "build_debug"
<li> In "Behaviour": In "Build (incremential build)" remove "all"
<li> Disable automatically build: In Heading bar: "Project"-> remove "Build automatically"
</ol>

You find the binary in "ug4/bin/" with the name "ugshell"

<hr>
\section secInstallEcpliseRunExecutable	Run ug-executable via Eclipse
<hr>

If you want you can also start the executable from Eclipse. This is especially
useful if you like to use the build-in Debugger. 

<ol>
<li> "ug4" -> "Properties"
<li> "Run/Debug Settings"
<li> Click "New..." -> "C/C++ Application"
<li> Fill in executable: "Browse" -> "ug4/bin/ugshell"
<li> Choose "Arguments" -> "Program arguments": Fill in: "-ex laplace.lua"
</ol>

Of coarse, if needed, use adapted arguments.

<hr>
\section secInstallEcplisePathSymbols Path and Symbols
<hr>

Eclipse has a powerful Autocompletion-Mechanism, Syntax-Highlighting for C++ and
many other things. To make them available, you have to tell Eclipse, where to 
look for:

<ol>
<li> Click right on folder "ug4" -> Choose "Properties"
<li> Under "C/C++-General" -> "Path and Symbols"
<li> Under "Includes" click "Add..."
<li> Click on "Workspace..." and choose the folder "ugbase"
<li> Check: "Add to all languages" and "Add to all configurations"
</ol> 

If you use build flags, you must tell Eclipse to recognize them. Specially, 
if you do not use UG_PARALLEL, all Parallel Code will not be highlighted but 
regarded as dead code. So, add it to the Environment:

<ol>
<li> Click right on folder "ug4" -> Choose "Properties"
<li> Under "C/C++-General" -> "Path and Symbols"
<li> Under "Symbols" click "Add..."
<li> Fill in "UG_PARALLEL", value: "ON"
<li> Check: "Add to all languages" and "Add to all configurations"
</ol> 


<hr>
\section secInstallEcpliseSyntaxLua Syntax Highlighting in Lua 
<hr>

Lua is the recommended scripting language in ug. In order to have a more comfortable
editing of Lua-Scripts you should install a Plugin. We recommend the package
LuaEclipse. This plugin provides editing of Lua scripts with syntax highlight,
 code completion, compilation errors, code and comment folding.

You find a link to the install site under: http://luaeclipse.luaforge.net/preview/update-site
E.g. on MacOSX use: http://luaeclipse.luaforge.net/preview/update-site/macosx.carbon/site.xml

<ol>
<li> Open plugin install panel: "Help" -> "Install new Software..."
<li> Insert link above into: "Work with: ...."
<li> Choose "LuaEclipse 1.3.1" and click "next"
<li> Accept license agreement
<li> Finish and restart
</ol>


A second (not recommended) choice is LunarEclispe (http://lunareclipse.sourceforge.net/update.html)

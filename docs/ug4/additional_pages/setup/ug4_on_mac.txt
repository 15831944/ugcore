/**	\page pageUG4OnMac Setting up UG on mac

To install ug4 on Mac OSX you need a working toolchain. For me it wasn't hassle-free as compared with a Unix based system, 
therefore Isearched the web.
\verbatim
Downloading and installing the massive Xcode installer is a huge hassle if you just want GCC and related tools.
The osx-gcc-installer allows you to install the essential compilers from either pre-built binary packages or helps you create your own installer.
\endverbatim  
There is a bundle called OSX GCC Installer (see above) which contains up-to-date versions of:
<ul>
<li> GCC </li>
<li> LLVM </li>
<li> Clang </li>
<li> Developer CLI Tools (purge, etc.)</li>
<li> DevSDK (headers, etc.) </li>
</ul>

Steps:
<ul>
<li> Download the prebuilt pkg from: https://github.com/kennethreitz/osx-gcc-installer/
(alternatively you can download Command Line Tools for Xcode with a free apple ID from 
http://developer.apple.com/downloads)</li>
<li> Install the pkg. For me the prebuilt pkgs worked flawless on Snow Leopard and Lion too (compiled UG4 rev 5289 with clang and gcc)</li>
</ul>
Please note, you can build your own. See http://kennethreitz.com/xcode-gcc-and-homebrew.html for further informations.

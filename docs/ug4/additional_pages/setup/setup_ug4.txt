\section general General Notes
<hr>
All examples are for running ug in parallel with $NP processors and $UGARGS as arguments.<br>
Except for your own Computer/Workstation, do NOT EVER use mpirun -np $NP ugshell to start your job on a cluster! The node you are logging into is only a login node, and you don't want to run your job on these. 
Be aware that by running mpirun -np $NP ugshell on a login node might crash the login node and make the administrator very angry with you :P.

You can use 
\verbatim
mpirun -np $NP ugshell $UGARGS
\endverbatim
to run ug.

\section secCekon Cekon
<hr>
Cekon is the in-house cluster of the G-CSC. It uses <a href="https://computing.llnl.gov/linux/slurm/"> SLURM </a> as a job control (<a href="https://computing.llnl.gov/linux/slurm/quickstart.html">Quickstart</a>).<br>
 Start your job with
\verbatim
salloc -n $NP mpirun ugshell $UGARGS
\endverbatim

\section secInstallUG4Boost Boost
<hr>

<ul>
<li> <b>Boost</b>: Download latest release of Boost from <a href="http://www.boost.org/users/download/">http://www.boost.org/users/download/</a> .
<li> Extract/Copy the library to some folder on your computer. The folder is arbitrary. 
	(e.g. home/lib/boost_1_46_0)
<li> Add the path of the folder, where boost is located, to the environment 
	variable <a href="http://www.linuxheadquarters.com/howto/basic/path.shtml">PATH</a>, e.g.: 
	<ul>
	<li> in bash: add <i>PATH=$PATH:$HOME/lib/boost_1_46_0</i> to the end of the file ~/.bashrc 
	<li> in tcsh/csh: add <i>set PATH = ($PATH $HOME/lib/boost_1_46_0)</i> to the end of the file ~/.tcshrc
	</ul>
</ul> 

<hr>
\section secInstallUG4CMake CMake
<hr>

<ul>
<li> <b>CMake</b>: Download CMake from <a href="http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html">http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html</a> (min Release 2.6)
<li> Install cmake on your computer. Install the command line tools, when requested during installation.
<li> Open a terminal window. Enter cmake<Enter>. If you see some output "cmake version ..." cmake has been installed correctly.
</ul>

<hr>
\section secInstallUG4UG4 ug4
<hr>

<ul>
<li> <b>ug4</b>: Download ug4 from the repository <br />
		svn checkout svn://fuji.gcsc.uni-frankfurt.de/ug4
</ul>

<hr>
\section secInstallUG4RunCmake Run CMake
<hr>

<ol>
<li> Open a terminal/shell window
<li> move to ug4/trunk/
<li> "mkdir build_debug"
<li> "cd build_debug"
<li> "cmake -DDEBUG=ON .." --> Makefiles are generated
</ol>

Note, that there are several options, that can be passed to cmake to change
the build behaviour. You see always the current chosen setup when runnig cmake
and you should see a list of options which you can change. In order to change
an option run cmake again with the parameter -D<option>=<val>, where <option>
is one of the enumerated options and <val> is one of the possible values for
that option ('<' and '>' should of course not be typed). The last argument to
cmake always has to be the path which you used when you called cmake the first time.

Note that you only have to specify the variables which you want to change. All other
variables will keep their values.

As default ug is build for all supported world dimensions (Dim = 1,2,3). If 
you only need a special dimension (e.g. for code development) and you want to 
save compilation time, use the -DDIM option. Examples:

<ul>
<li> "cmake -DDIM=ALL .." -> Builds all dimensions
<li> "cmake -DDIM=2 .." -> Builds only dimension 2
<li> "cmake -DDIM="2;3" .." -> Builds dimension 2 and 3, but not 1
</ul>

For cmake Versions old than 2.8 yo may be forced to explicitly specify, that
the option DIM is passed as a string. So, please use:
"cmake -DDIM:STRING=2 .." etc.

\section secInstallUG4Make Make
<hr>

<ol>
<li> move to ug4/trunk/build_debug
<li> "make" --> ug4 is build
</ol>

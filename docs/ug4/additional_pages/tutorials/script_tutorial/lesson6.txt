We already have seen how a grid can be distributed using DistributeDomain(...).
In this tutorial however we'll take a look at how distribution can be controled
in a more flexible way.
We will thus take a look at how to prepare a PartitionMap and how to use
it in a call to RedistributeDomain.

Below you'll find the scripts sources. They are the same as in
scripts/tutorials/tut06_flexible_grid_distribution.lua

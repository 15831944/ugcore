\section secInstallUG4Boost Boost
<hr>

<ul>
<li> <b>Boost</b>: Download latest release of Boost from "www.boost.org".
<li> Copy the library to some folder on your computer. The folder is arbitrary. 
	(e.g. home/lib/boost_1_46_0)
<li> Add the path of the folder, where boost is located, to the environment 
	variable PATH
	(e.g. 	export BOOST_ROOT = $HOME/lib/boost_1_46_0)
</ul> 

<hr>
\section secInstallUG4CMake CMake
<hr>

<ul>
<li> <b>CMake</b>: Download Cmake from "www.cmake.org" (min Release 2.6)
<li> Install cmake on your computer. Install the command line tools, when requested 
	during installation.
</ul>

<hr>
\section secInstallUG4UG4 ug4
<hr>

<ul>
<li> <b>ug4</b>: Download ug4 from the repository <br />
		svn checkout svn://fuji.gcsc.uni-frankfurt.de/ug4
</ul>

<hr>
\section secInstallUG4RunCmake Run Cmake
<hr>

<ol>
<li> Open a terminal/shell window
<li> move to ug4/trunk/
<li> "mkdir build_debug"
<li> "cd build_debug"
<li> "cmake -DUG_DEBUG=ON .." --> Makefiles are generated
</ol>

Note, that there are several options, that can be passed to cmake to change
the build behaviour. You see always the current chosen setup when runnig cmake
and usually you see what options you can choose. 

As default ug is build for all supported world dimensions (Dim = 1,2,3). If 
you only need a special dimension (e.g. for code development) and you want to 
save compilation time, use the -DDIM option. Examples:

<ul>
<li> "cmake -DDIM=ALL .." -> Builds all dimensions
<li> "cmake -DDIM=2 .." -> Builds only dimension 2
<li> "cmake -DDIM="2;3" .." -> Builds dimension 2 and 3, but not 1
</ul>

For cmake Versions old than 2.8 yo must explicitly specify, that in the option
DIM is passed a string. So, please use:
"cmake -DDIM:STRING=2 .." etc.

<hr>
\section secInstallUG4Make Make
<hr>

<ol>
<li> move to ug4/trunk/build_debug
<li> "make" --> ug4 is build
</ol>

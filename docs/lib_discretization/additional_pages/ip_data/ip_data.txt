/**	\page pageLDIPData libDiscretization - IP Data

An IElemDisc object can assemble the local stiffness/mass matrix and/or the local
defect/rhs. In order to accomplish this task a, often user defined data is needed
for several integration points on the element. On this page, we describe the
idea of the IPData import, that is used in ug. 

	- \ref secIPData "IPData"

<hr>
\section secDataImport Data Import
<hr>
Each IElemDisc may have several data imports, describing some user defined 
functions. To give an idea, this may be a Diffusion Tensor, a Velocity field,
 some reaction constants, etc. 
 
The IElemDisc tells the DataImport, at which integration points it wants to 
evaluate the data. Then, after a computation phase (SPECIFY WHEN THIS HAPPENS), 
the data can be accessed at the integration points.

\section secIPData IP Data
<hr>

In ug, we distinguish four kinds of IP Data:

<ul>
<li> zero data
<li> constant data
<li> data depending on \f$ (\vec{x}, t) \f$, i.e. on the global space coordinate and
	the time.
<li> data produced by other IElemDiscs.
</ul>

The base class for the last three data, is the class 
\code 
template <typename TData>
class IPData
\endcode.

This class can provide the data for the templated type. It knowns:

<ul>
<li> The number of integration points
<li> The Data at the integration points
</ul>

Note, that we have to serve a varity of possible setting. This ranges between
to extrems:

<ul>
<li> data is used several times at exactly the same points. Thus, we want to
	 compute the data only once.
<li> data is needed at different points. Thus, several data sets must be 
	 produced using the same evaluation function, but at different points.
</ul>

<hr>
\section secIPDataOffer	IP Data Offer
<hr>
To provide this flexibility, the IPDataOffer is introduced. This object can
create new IPData. This is needed, when more then one pointlist is used.

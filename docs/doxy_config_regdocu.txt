# The TAGFILES option can be used to specify one or more tagfiles. For each
# tag file the location of the external documentation should be added. The
# format of a tag file without this location is as follows:
#
# TAGFILES = file1 file2 ...
# Adding location for the tag files is done as follows:
#
# TAGFILES = file1=loc1 "file2 = loc2" ...
# where "loc1" and "loc2" can be relative or absolute paths
# or URLs. Note that each tag file must have a unique name (where the name does
# NOT include the path). If a tag file is not located in the directory in which
# doxygen is run, you must also specify the path to the tagfile here.
